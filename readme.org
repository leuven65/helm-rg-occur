* About
~helm-rg-occur~ is elisp package to enhance the performace of ~helm-swoop~
[[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/helm-swoop]] and ~helm-occur~ [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm]] on
large size file, by using the ripgrep to do the grep on the file content.

If the file is in large size, such as 10M, both ~helm-swoop~ or ~helm-occur~ is quite slow, and
Emacs will be blocked. But with ~helm-rg-occur~, it is quite fast, and no performance issue.

2. ~helm-swoop-with-rg-occur~ is to replace the command ~helm-swoop~. \\
   The command "helm-swoop" in global keymap is rebound to this command.
